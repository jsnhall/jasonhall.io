This year has already been filled with exciting new stuff to learn. I have learned all about Gatsby, deploying sites with Netlify and have sharpened my skills in React. However, the learning never stops in the industry of web development, so I have laid out the top 5 things I want to improve on or learn for the remaining year of 2019.

## 1. Semantic HTML and Accessibility

Accessibility is so important in web development and often overlooked. It is my goal as a web developer to ensure that the pages I develop can be used by anyone. Recently, I have learned [how screen reader users navigate through web pages](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/02/accessibility-webinar/) and it has occurred to me that I need to work on improving the user experience for these individuals who rely on this technology.
