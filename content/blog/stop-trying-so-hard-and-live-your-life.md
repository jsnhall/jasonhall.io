Do you stress over not knowing the newest frameworks or development trends? Are you anxious because you think you should be learning all about array destructuring instead of binge watching Game of Thrones for the second time with your significant other? Are you depressed because after all the hours you put in learning new things, you know you still aren't as knowledgeable as all those cool devs on Twitter that seem to know it all? If so, I'm here to say stop trying so hard and live your life!

The reason I say this is because I've experienced everything I've mentioned above: stress, anxiety and depression from worrying about where I stand in my career and knowledge in the industry of web development.

For the past six years I have dedicated myself to learning. I went to college for genetics, cell and developmental biology with ambitions of becoming a molecular biologist. I spent all my time outside of class head down in the books studying to get the highest grade in the class come exam day. My senior year is when I realized that I was only impressing my parents and girlfriend at the time, now wife, with the A+. Nobody else gave a shit. 

Professors wouldn't give me the time of day to even write back about my inquiry about doing undergraduate research. I presented the grades and the interest, but it wasn't enough. It was clear to me that employers would do the same after graduating. I knew I had to do something, so I gave up on my nerdy dream of becoming a scientist and pursued another nerdy path in web development.

I spent the rest of my senior year in class coding landing pages, learning JavaScript, and styling websites like it was 1999. Believe it or not, this was enough to get me in the industry! I somehow got an unpaid internship at an advertising agency - which I'm pretty sure I got because their better option bailed - and another unpaid internship for a natural lighting company. 

I knew it was only the beginning and had to continue to learn if I wanted to be a bad ass programmer. Back to the books (Google and Stack Overflow) I went, and I've been studying dev ever since.

I'm now employed full-time as a front-end developer, and you could say that I've "made it" as a developer, but here's the problem. I still spend all my free time learning! I'm obsessed with becoming better.

This is problematic because for the last 6 years of my life, I have put everything else on the back burner to perfect my craft. My friends, family and my health come in behind learning the newest framework or CSS trend, and that is complete bullshit!
