For the past several years I have dedicated myself to learning. I went to college for genetics, cell and developmental biology with ambitions of becoming a molecular biologist. I spent all my time outside of class head down in the books studying to get the highest grade in the class come exam day. My senior year is when I realized that I was only impressing my parents and girlfriend at the time, now wife, with the A+. Literally, nobody else gave a shit. Professors wouldn't give me the time of day to even write back about my inquiry about doing undergraduate research. I presented the grades and the interest, but it wasn't enough. It was clear to me that employers would do the same after graduating. I knew I had to do something, so I gave up on my dream and pursued a path in web development.

I spent the rest of my senior year in class coding landing pages, learning JavaScript, and styling websites like it was 1999. Believe it or not, this was enough to get me in the industry! I somehow got an unpaid internship at an advertising agency, which I'm pretty sure I got because their better option bailed, and another unpaid internship for a natural lighting company. I knew it was only the beginning and had to continue to learn if I wanted to be a bad ass programmer. Back to the books (web) I went, and I've been studying dev ever since.

I'm now employed full-time as a front-end developer, and you could say that I've "made it" as a developer, but here's the problem. I still spend all my free time learning! I'm obsessed with becoming better.
