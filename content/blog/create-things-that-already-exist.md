Today I shared an application idea with somebody who I thought would have an interest in it. It turns out, they thought it would be a lot of work for something they could achieve using another app. This wasn't the reaction I was expecting, but it was a valid point nonetheless.

Even though I quickly brushed off the comment (since my app would have additional features and obviously be way cooler than the competition), it immediately got me thinking about this kind of "it's already been done" mentality.

This mentality is extremely negative and will limit you in life from creating great new things. Imagine for a second, a world where there is only one of everything. A world where people didn't create things because that idea they have has already been done before. There would be no competition, and zero product innovation.

It turns out that just about everything around you has already been created over and over again. Take cars, televisions, restaurants, dating apps, computers, web development agencies and a gallon of milk for instance. All of these things have been produced over and over again by different people and different brands all over the world.

It's obvious to me that this mentality doesn't work well if you want to create something amazing in life. You have to do the things you believe in and not worry if it's already been done before.

Who cares if your idea's already out there or if somebody can use another platform instead? Keep doing the things you love and building awesome stuff for you and the world to enjoy because, who knows, you could create or discover the next life changing thing.

I'll leave you with this quote by a person who changed the world in his time. "If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants." - Issac Newton
