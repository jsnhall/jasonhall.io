So far this year, I have learned all about [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), deploying sites with [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/) and have sharpened my [React](https://reactjs.org/) skills, but the learning doesn't stop there. Here, I have laid out the top 5 things I want to learn or improve on for the remaining year of 2019. Each topic contains a list of resources that will bring value in leveling up in these areas.

## 1. Semantic HTML and Accessibility

Semantic HTML and Accessibility are so important in web development and often overlooked. It is my goal as a web developer to ensure that the pages I develop can be used by anyone. Recently, I have learned [how screen reader users navigate through web pages](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/02/accessibility-webinar/) and it has occurred to me that I need to work on improving the user experience for these individuals who rely on this technology.

* [Events](https://a11yproject.com/events)
* [The A11Y Project](https://a11yproject.com/)

## 2. Testing

Okay, I'll admit it. I don't test like I should. My tests consist of checking the console, clicking around to make sure everything works as intended and eyeing the page in question in one or two other browsers not named Chrome. Well, things are about to change as testing will be a top priority for me here on out.

* [Lighthouse web page audits](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/)

## 3. Redux

[Redux](https://redux.js.org/), a predictable state container for JavaScript apps, has been one of those things that I've wanted to learn for a while, but I never really had a use for it until now. My applications are becoming more complex and it's apparent to me that utilizing Redux will be essential.

* [Redux documentation](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started)
* [Redux tutorial](https://redux.js.org/basics/basic-tutorial)
* [Modern React with Redux - Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)
* [Redux Crash Course with React - Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93p3LxR9xfM)

## 4. Flexbox and CSS Grid

Flexbox and CSS Grid are amazing tools that can assist in building beautiful and responsive layouts. I know the basics of flexbox and always tend to resort to the MDN docs when setting up a CSS grid. It's my goal to go from the basics to a master layout ninja. How will I do this? Well, I'll still resort to the docs, but it's all about practice, practice, practice!

**Resources**

* [Grid by Example](https://gridbyexample.com/examples/)
* [MDN documentation - CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout)
* [MDN documentation - Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox)
* [Flexbox Zombies - Game](https://flexboxzombies.com/p/flexbox-zombies)
* [Layout Land](https://www.youtube.com/layoutland)

## 5. Serverless Computing

I've recently come across the idea of serverless computing and it sounds amazing! Serverless allows you to build and run applications and services without thinking about servers. This gives more control to us front-end developers so we can worry less about managing and operating servers or runtimes and more about the core product.
