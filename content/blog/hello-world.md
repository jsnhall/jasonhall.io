Hello, World. I'm so happy to finally meet you! Let me start by introducing myself. My name is Jason Hall, and I'm a front-end developer who currently works for the Professional Beauty Association in Scottsdale, Arizona. 

I've created this blog to write about my personal experiences and things that I learn in web development, but before we get into the juicy coding stuff, let me provide a brief background about how I got into the industry. 

I began my journey in web development just over two years ago while I was still in college. At that time, I had aspirations of building the next big thing, but it didn't take me very long to realize that web development is hard. I still remember being completely lost learning JavaScript for the first time, and quite frankly, I still am at times.

It took me a few months to land a couple of unpaid internships as a junior developer that I was able to eventually turn into paid positions. After a few months, the work ran out, and I was out of a job. I spent a couple of months searching for a full-time position and it finally led me to where I am now.

For the time being, I've given up on building the next big thing. Instead, I've focused my attention on learning to be the best front-end developer I can be. I believe that writing is an excellent way to solidify my knowledge in the industry, and is why this blog exists. I look forward to learning, writing and sharing all things web development.
