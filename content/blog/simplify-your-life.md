If you haven't heard by now, then let me be the first to tell you that web development is complex in the year 2019. The pressure that comes with learning it to become employed can be overwhelming, especially if you are older and attempting a career change.

If you refer to [Kamran Ahmed's Developer Roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap#introduction), a roadmap to becoming a web developer in 2019, you'll see how much there is to know just to be a front-end developer. Attempting to learn all this in the shortest amount of time possible can cause tremendous amounts of stress, anxiety and many sleepless nights. I know this because I've experienced it.

Many will say you shouldn't try to learn that fast, you won't be successful if you try and (insert negative comment here), but if you're anything like me, then you don't really have a choice.

I had a steady job that I quit in my late 20's to go to college full time. I realized in college that, to become a molecular biologist, I would have to have a higher degree than a bachelors (or experience). No way was I going to spend more godly amounts of money for that. I had bills piling up and rent to help pay for as Megan, my wife, could only take on so much by herself. After discovering my passion for web development, I had no other choice but to learn it quickly so I could become employable and start earning an income again.

This is where it all began for me. While I absolutely love what I do, I was experiencing these terrible feelings while trying to cram everything in, and once I finally found a good job in the industry, the feelings didn't go away. I still felt inadequate and pressured to keep learning as much as could and as fast as I could, but I learned how to overcome it.

Recently, I've found peace with where I stand as a web developer, and if you're sitting in the same boat as I was, then I'm here to tell you that you can too.

  return false;

For me, I  for to learn development in your late 20's and early 30's is no easy task, especially when you're counting on your newly accumulated knowledge to land you a job.

If you're anything like me, then these 

I have experienced a great amount of stress, anxiety and plenty of sleepless nights over the past few years as a developer dealing with these complexities. 

So you may ask, "If it caused you so much stress, anxiety and sleeplessness then why were you doing it in the first place?" This is a valid question, and one I can answer easily. I love what I do! 

It's these words that made me realize that web development isn't what was causing me to freak out all the time. It was me.

Since there is such an incredible amount

I'm competitive by nature, and my greatest compitition is me. I challenge and push myself too much at times. to learn as much as possible in a short time

However, I've recently found peace with where I stand as a web developer.

Simplify your life, remove the noise, since the work complex.

1. Clean out your inbox, forward gmails, unsubscribe to marketing junk
2. Clean up the apps on your phone. Remove ones you never go on. Organize them in folders.
3. Deactivate your social media. It's addictive mind junk. Your family and friends can still get ahold of you. It'll be okay.
4. Remove all the junk from your closet and kitchen that you've been packing around from apartment to apartment.
5. 

These are just a start. You can do whatever is needed to simplify your life. For now web development will stay complex. While we can't fight that we can change other aspects to counter balance the complexity.
