If you haven't heard by now, then let me be the first to tell you. Web development is complex in the year 2019.

Whether you're just starting out or a seasoned vet, you need to know a ton of stuff to be employable in the industry. If you refer to [Kamran Ahmed's Developer Roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap#introduction), a roadmap to becoming a web developer in 2019, you'll see how complex it is just to be a front-end developer. I don't know about you, but it makes my head hurt trying to follow it.

The complexity of the industry has caused stress, great anxiety, and many sleepless nights for me over the past couple of years, but I'm close to finding peace with where I stand in web development now. 

Simplify your life, remove the noise, since the work complex.

1. Clean out your inbox, forward gmails, unsubscribe to marketing junk

2. Clean up the apps on your phone. Remove ones you never go on. Organize them in folders.

3. Deactivate your social media. It's addictive mind junk. Your family and friends can still get ahold of you. It'll be okay.

4. Remove all the junk from your closet and kitchen that you've been packing around from apartment to apartment.

5.

These are just a start. You can do whatever is needed to simplify your life. For now web development will stay complex. While we can't fight that we can change other aspects to counter balance the complexity.
