I recently came across [Front-end Developer Interview Questions](https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions) on GitHub. It's a repository that serves as a helpful tool to prepare developers for landing their dream job as a front-end developer by asking several questions from different categories that are relevant to the wonderful world of front-end development. While this is great and all, none of the questions have answers to them. I'm going to create a post for each category and attempt to answer them one by one starting with HTML. Let's begin!

## 1. What does a DOCTYPE do?

Browsers can differ in the type of rendering mode they use. By using a `DOCTYPE`, you're telling the browser to make its best attempt at rendering your document following the relevant specification. For example, using `<!DOCTYPE html>` tells the browser that your document contains HTML5 and that it should follow standards for rendering HTML.
